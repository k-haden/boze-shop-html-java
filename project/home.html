				  Boze Space Shipping, a collaboration of Boze Elementary 5th grade students and students from the University of Washington Tacoma, has been exploring ways to provide goods and/or services for the space station as well as other crafts currently in outer space. <br><br>

		Our Mission is to produce a website that will help support astronauts currently in space by supplying them with choices of food, clothing, and satellite communication. Currently on shuttle launches astronauts have a limited amount of space on the craft as well as a weight limit. Boze Space Shipping will be providing a space shipping service to help address these issues and help astronauts live a little more comfortably while on their journey in space. The website will have a choice of spacesuits, new clothing, food, and satellite services for communication with family and friends on earth.
